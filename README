NAME
    Types::URI - type constraints and coercions for URIs

SYNOPSIS
       package FroobleDocument;
   
       use Moose;
       use Types::URI -all;
   
       has source => (
          is      => 'ro',
          isa     => Uri,
          coerce  => 1,
       );

DESCRIPTION
    Types::URI is a type constraint library suitable for use with Moo/Moose
    attributes, Kavorka sub signatures, and so forth.

  Types
    This module provides some type constraints broadly compatible with those
    provided by MooseX::Types::URI, plus a couple of extra type constraints.

    `Uri`
        A class type for URI/URI::WithBase. Coercions from:

        from `Uuid`
            Coerces to a URI in the `urn:uuid:` schema. (See Types::UUID.)

        from `Str`
            Uses "new" in URI.

        from `Path`
            Uses "new" in URI::file. (See Types::Path::Tiny.)

        from `ScalarRef`
            Uses "new" in URI::data.

        from `HashRef`
            Coerces using URI::FromHash.

    `FileUri`
        A subtype of `Uri` covering URI::file. Coercions from:

        from `Str`
            Uses "new" in URI::file.

        from `Path`
            Uses "new" in URI::file. (See Types::Path::Tiny.)

    `DataUri`
        A subtype of `Uri` covering URI::data. Coercions from:

        from `Str`
            Uses "new" in URI::data.

        from `ScalarRef`
            Uses "new" in URI::data.
